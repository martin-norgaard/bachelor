# Undergraduate Thesis
> Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen

The repository contains data and iPython-files for replication of Farhi and Gourio (2018) on data for the United Kingdom. Farhi and Gourio's paper <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/accounting-for-macro-finance-trends-market-power-intangibles-and-risk-premia/">may be downloaded here.</a>

Farhi and Gourio's data for the US and MATLAB-replication files are available on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BirmmvgcrsTRO3iiYpDqiSsJ06ETEBu2/view">Fran&ccedil;ois Gourio's website</a>. Note that if you receive a data-read error, you may wish to use a semi-colon seperated CSV-file. You may find a semi-colon seperated copy of Farhi and Gourio's <a href="http://www.norgaardpetersen.dk/thesis_files/FG_data_scsv.csv">here</a>

**Publish date:** The final paper will be available on <a href="http://www.norgaardpetersen.dk">norgaardpetersen.dk</a> in December 2019.

## Overview
This repository entails the followingly Python-files:

- data.ipynb 
- analysis.ipynb
- graphs.ipynb

The data.ipynb file imports data and does relevant calculations based hereon, as described in the paper. The main analysis.ipynb file consists of a calibration part and a decomposition part, first calibrating the model and then calculating the contributions from each parameter. Finally, the graphs.ipynb file produces all graphs.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. Please reach out for any questions.
