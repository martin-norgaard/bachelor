The repository contains data and iPython-files for replication of Farhi and Gourio (2018) on data for the United Kingdom. Farhi and Gourio's paper <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/accounting-for-macro-finance-trends-market-power-intangibles-and-risk-premia/">may be downloaded here.</a>

Farhi and Gourio's data for the US and MATLAB-replication files are available on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BirmmvgcrsTRO3iiYpDqiSsJ06ETEBu2/view">Fran&ccedil;ois Gourio's website</a>. Note that if you receive a data-read error, you may wish to use a semi-colon seperated CSV-file. You may find a semi-colon seperated copy of Farhi and Gourio's data in our data-folder.
